# ML-assignment-IBM
This is the final assignment for Machine Learning with Python course available on Coursera, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization. 

### This notebook explores the application of several classification algorithms:
1. KNearest Neighbors(KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression

### In my analysis, I go through the following steps:
- loading the dataset
- data visualization and pre-processing
- feature selection
- one hot encoding
- data standardization 
- classification with the algorithms mentioned above

## Classification process includes:
- importing the necessary libraries
- training the model 
- making the prediction
- calculating accuracy
