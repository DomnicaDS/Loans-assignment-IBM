# Loans prediction assignment
This is the final assignment for Machine Learning with Python course available on Coursera, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization. 

This dataset is about past loans and includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. My goal is to find the best classification algorithm in order to predict if a loan will be paid off or defaulted.


### This notebook explores the application of several classification algorithms:
1. KNearest Neighbors(KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression

### In my analysis, I go through the following steps:
- loading the dataset
- data visualization and pre-processing
- feature selection
- one hot encoding
- data standardization 
- classification with the algorithms mentioned above

## Classification process includes:
- importing the necessary libraries
- training the model 
- making the prediction
- calculating accuracy
